# Wai Project: ELI5 Summary

## What is Wai?

Wai is like a super-smart helper that can read different types of documents stored in different places and bring all that information together for you.

## What Can Wai Do Right Now?

### Read from Notion
Wai can grab text from your Notion pages. It's like having someone who can look at your Notion notes and copy the important parts for you.

### Read from Google
Wai can also read your Google Docs and Spreadsheets. It's like having a friend who can look at your documents and tell you what's inside without you having to open them yourself.

### Combine Information
The coolest part is that Wai can grab information from all these different places using the same commands. You don't need separate tools for each service!

## How Does It Work?

1. You tell Wai what document you want to read (like "get me that Google Doc" or "read this Notion page")
2. Wai connects to that service (Notion or Google)
3. Wai gets the information and shows it to you
4. If you want, Wai can save that information to a file on your computer

## What's Next?

Right now, Wai is like a really good reader. In the future, it could become a super-smart assistant that not only reads but also:
- Understands what the documents mean
- Finds connections between different documents
- Answers questions about your documents
- Organizes information automatically
- Maybe even writes new content based on what it reads

Wai is just getting started, but it's already helping you access information from different sources more easily!
